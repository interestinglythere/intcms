## pstats.py

Please download this from [svn.python.org](http://svn.python.org/) if your Python installation doesn't include the `pstats` module. Pick the highest version that works with your version of Python at:

    http://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/releaseXX-maint/Lib/pstats.py

For example, here's Python 2.4's `pstats.py`:

If you can already `import pstats`, hooray! Don't do anything; the default should already be the best one.
